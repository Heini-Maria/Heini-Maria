# Hi there, I'm Heini-Maria 👋

### I am a frontend developer with a marketing backround

I'm Finnish but based in Malta. I am fairly new in coding but I'm super happy I followed my intuition and decided to start learning. I just love creating stuff and seeing it work on the internet.

I'm constantly trying to grow and learn new skills. <br />

☁️ I lose track of time when I am coding, doing crafts and using my creativity.

## My skills:

REACT /REACT NATIVE /REDUX /JS /HTML /CSS

## What I'm focusing on

* 🔎 currently deepening my knowledge of algorithms and asymptotic notations
* 🧼 improving my code for easier testing
