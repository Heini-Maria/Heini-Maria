# Hi there, I'm Heini-Maria 👋

### I am a frontend developer with a marketing background

I'm a Finn, based in Malta. I am still fresh in coding but I'm grateful that I dared to my intuition and decided to start learning. I love the process of creating stuff, figuring things out, overcoming obstacles and seeing the end result running live on the internet.

I'm constantly trying to grow and learn new skills. <br />

☁️ I lose track of time when I am coding, doing crafts and using my creativity.

## My skills:

REACT /REACT NATIVE /REDUX /JS /HTML /CSS /TYPESCRIPT /SQL

## What I'm focusing on

* 📖 Currently working as a junior frontend developer 
* 🔎 Looking into learning more about animations and transitions
* 🚀 Learning something new every day, and loving it!
